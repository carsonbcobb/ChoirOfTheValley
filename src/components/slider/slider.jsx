									me. To say that it changed my life is an understatement for so
									many reasons. Having no idea what to expect, I can tell you
									that from the first practice, I was blown away at the talent
									of this group. To have this avenue to express myself musically
									has been such a Godsend…but the “family” and lifelong friends
									I have met through this group will stay with me forever.”

									to sing choral music! I love working on learning my part and
									when all the parts come together, it's just the best! I enjoy
									the people I've met, people of all ages! We are all there to
									have fun, and in the process, sing some amazing choral music
									together. Ed is the best director and chooses the most
									wonderful pieces for us to sing! Please come and join us!”

									“The choir has been a joy. Ed makes the work challenging at
									times, but always fun. The music selected is joyful and even a
									little emotional on occasion. We are pushed beyond what we
									think are our limits and encouraged by accomplishing what we
									thought we couldn't. Most important is the value of
									fellowship. We feel as "family" and share our needs and
									blessings to give comfort and help to the other members. ”

									challenging, fun, and encouraging. The variety of songs
									relating to the season they are sung makes it exciting and

									are humble, engaging, and driven to make it exactly what it
									is, a Community of people coming together to share their
									talents and enjoy music.”

									“Clovis Community Choir provides opportunities for all singers
									to share their talent and meet like people who enjoy music and
									socializing. I have been a member of various choruses
									throughout my life and this one ranks on top of the list.
									Director Ed Cobb selects music from many genres and manages to
									draw the best from each of us who possess varied stages of
									singing skills. Music is so healing and was missed so much
									during the past year of Covid. I am looking forward to getting
									back to practice with the Choir and reconnecting with old
									friends once again.”
